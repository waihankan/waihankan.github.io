    <p>Several weeks ago, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thai_lottery#Demographics">2D Lottery</a> was increasingly trending on my Facebook newsfeed. While some people were mourning because of losing, others were being <strong>House</strong> themselves. And of course, there would also be a couple of people who won the lottery because the chances of winning are really high: 1 in 100. Incidentally, one of my friends in my Facebook account is a <strong>House</strong> and posted about rules and regulations. Here is the simple rule:</p>

<blockquote>
  <font size="4">If you win the lottery, you will get 80x of what you had paid.</font>
</blockquote>

<p>This rule stuck out to me, and I thought a lot about this. I asked one of my friends to give it a try; he said <em>“Yes”</em>, and sent me 10 random numbers. I reversed all of his numbers - a total of 20 numbers - and gave it a chance. In retrospect, I reckon this was <strong>really stupid</strong>, and I will explain why in the following paragraphs.</p>

<hr />
<p><br /></p>
<h3 id="superstitions">Superstitions</h3>
<p>Most people pick numbers from dreams, news, events or oddities they observe: the number of bananas on a stalk or the appearance of a two-headed fish, cats with strange markings, the pattern a snake leaves in the dirt, bla bla..</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Various websites and soothsayers help interpret these events, with rats viewed as a one, water a two, snakes a five (large) or six (small), and anything related to royalty a nine. Many Thais (<em>including Myanmar</em>) believe that calamity can beget good fortune, and that tragedy may give rise to powerful ghosts who offer guidance on winning numbers. - Wikipedia</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In fact, this kind of information increases the odd of the <strong>House</strong> winning. Since the lottery numbers are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_(probability_theory)">stastically independent</a>. A lot of people try to figure out some form of a pattern in lottery ticket. In reality, there is no absolute pattern to it and winning always happen to be <strong>random</strong>.</p>

<p>Let’s talk about <em>the fortune tellers</em>; aka <em>the number givers</em>. From my poor research, they usually announce 16 numbers everyday. Let’s think about this properly. The probability of he/she getting the right number is already <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cfn_cm%20%5Cfrac%7B16%7D%7B100%7D" alt="" />. Instead of following his numbers, you can also choose some random 16 numbers, which would lead to the same probability of winning.</p>

<hr />
<p><br /></p>
<h3 id="probability-and-gambling-mathematics">Probability and Gambling Mathematics</h3>
<p>Here is an example to demonstrate the maths behind the 2D lottery. Let’s say you play the game with 100 MMK. The probability of winning 80x is 0.01; and the probability of lossing 100 is 0.99. To calculate the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expected_value">expected value</a>:</p>

<p><strong>Expected Value</strong> = <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cfn_jvn%20%5Csmall%208000%20*%5Cfrac%7B1%7D%7B100%7D%20-%20100*%5Cfrac%7B99%7D%7B100%7D" alt="" /> = <strong>- 19</strong> MMK</p>

<p>Here, you might say “Well, this is just the expected value. How can I know that my bet will exactly turn out to be like this? I could be so <em>lucky</em> and the luck turns into a <em>winning streak</em>.”</p>

<p>However, according to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_large_numbers">Law Of Large Numbers</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The average of the results obtained from a large number of trials should be close to the expected value and will tend to become closer to the expected value as more trials are performed.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c9/Lawoflargenumbers.svg/600px-Lawoflargenumbers.svg.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>To make it easier to understand:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>When tossing a fair coin for 5 times, it is feasible to get a 5 head or 5 tail straight. But, when it comes to 1000 times, it is almost impossible to get a 1000 head or 1000 tail straight.</p>
</blockquote>

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Simulation of a coin that is red on one side and blue on the other side</strong></td>
      <td><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/49/Lawoflargenumbersanimation2.gif" alt="" /></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<hr />
<p><br /></p>

<p>Besides, let’s calculate the <strong>House Edge</strong>, which is the average tendency of the House “<strong>Winning</strong>” or You “<strong>Loosing</strong>”. Using Expected Value (19 MMK) from the previous calculation:</p>

<p><strong>House Edge</strong> =  <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cfn_jvn%20%5Csmall%20%5Cfrac%7BExpectedValue%7D%7BAmountSpentByGambler%7D%20*%20100%25" alt="" />  =  <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cfn_jvn%20%5Csmall%20%5Cfrac%7B19%7D%7B100%7D%20*%20100%25" alt="" /> —&gt; <strong>19%</strong></p>

<p><em>House Edge of 19% is ridiculous!!!</em>; that’s why in the beginning of this blog, I said it’s a stupid bet.</p>

<p>To explain it briefly, if you bet <em>2000 MMK</em> everyday for a month (30-days), you will be losing approximately <em>11400 MMK</em> every month! For a year? It will be <em>136800 MMK</em>! Of course, this value is not accurate enough since the number of trials is fairly small and billions away from approaching infinity.</p>

<p><em>My opinion here is if you win big accidentally, just quit and leave the game</em>.</p>

<hr />
<p><br /></p>

<p>If you still believing that 2D lottery is a cash cow, you must take a look at other types of casino games and their house advantage</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackjack">Blackjack</a> - 1.5%</li>
  <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craps">Craps</a> - 1.4% - 5%</li>
  <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baccarat_(card_game)">Baccarat</a> - 1.5%</li>
  <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roulette">Roulette</a> - 5.26%</li>
</ul>

<p>PS. I am just speculating here, and I’m not fond of gambling.. Furthermore, <a href="https://www.cleveland.com/business/2016/01/why_do_70_percent_of_lottery_w.html">about 70% of lottery winners end up bunkrupt</a>. But this makes my point. Don’t bet on something with big house edge value. Or, you would end up going flat broke! At the end of the day, it’s just a form of <strong>entertainment</strong>.</p>
